# Analysis of Language Trends in Ulysses S. Grant's Memoirs.

In this project, I conduct an NLP no-code/low-code analysis on Ulysses S. Grant's Memoirs. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that insightful, relatively in-depth analysis can be produced using no code/low code. The code that was involved in this project was hosted in a Jupyter Notebook in Google Colabâ€”nothing was stored or computed locally.
